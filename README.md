- **Specific Impulse Calculation**: By computing the specific impulse of the engine, users can assess its efficiency in converting propellant mass flow into thrust, facilitating performance comparisons, mission planning, and design optimization.
- **Propellant Dynamics Simulation**: Rocket Engine Simulation incorporates detailed models to simulate propellant consumption dynamics over time, accounting for factors such as burn rates, chamber pressure variations, transient effects, and propellant tank depletion.
- **Multi-Stage Simulation**: The simulation supports multi-stage rocket configurations, allowing users to analyze complex propulsion systems with multiple engine stages, including booster and upper-stage engines, for comprehensive mission planning and performance evaluation.

## Aerospace Working Principle
Rocket engines operate on the principle of Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the context of rocket propulsion, this principle manifests as the expulsion of mass at high velocities to generate thrust. During engine operation, combustion of propellant in the combustion chamber produces high-pressure exhaust gases, which are expelled through a nozzle at supersonic speeds. The accelerated mass flow creates a reaction force, propelling the rocket forward. The specific impulse of the engine quantifies its efficiency in converting propellant mass flow into thrust, with higher specific impulse values indicating greater efficiency and performance.
